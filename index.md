# Hello!

I am currently a student in Data Science at the London School of Economics, trying to create a home for my fun coursework and personal projects here. This is my first attempt to make a personal webpage. Your feedback would be highly appreciated!

## A bit about me

My academic passion lies at the intersection of data science and social sciences. 
I am currently building skills in Python, R, data management and visualization, machine learning and data mining, 
social network analysis, quantitative text analysis, artificial intelligence and deep learning, and you-name-it! 
I am hoping to learn the best practices of data science in the industry or research. 
My long-term goal is to use data to inform strategic decisionmaking, policymaking, and empower individuals, communities, organizations and even nations! 

My other passions include volunteering, taking intense dance classes, learning math theorems, 
bringing passionate (and rational) people together to solve problems for social impact, 
listening to people's life stories from all walks of life, seeing people around me thrive and shine, 
living like a local around the world, and seeing the world through the eyes of my two-year-old nephew.
